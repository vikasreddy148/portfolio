              Hello! I'm Vikas, a passionate web developer dedicated to creating
              exceptional digital experiences. Currently, I'm pursuing my B.Tech
              in Computer Science, where I continue to sharpen my skills in
              frontend and backend development.
            </p>
            <p>
              My journey in web development started during my academic years
              when I first discovered the power of building websites. Since
              then, I've worked on various projects, focusing on creating
              responsive, user-friendly, and dynamic web applications. Along the
              way, I also explored technologies like React, JavaScript, and
              Laravel, which strengthened my love for building scalable
              platforms.
            </p>
            <p>Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:</p>

                "HTML5",
                "Bootstrap",
                "MongoDB",
                "Express",
                "Redux",
                "TailwindCSS",
              ].map((tech, i) => (
                <li key={i} className="flex items-center gap-2">

                </li>
              ))}
            </ul>
